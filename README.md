### Why Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a widely recognized event designed to challenge developers of any language. The problems are presented as word problems themed around saving christmas. Lengthy input files are presented to emphasize automated and programmatic solutions to relatively uncomplicated problems, at least in the early days. As the days progress, complexity and difficulty do so as well. Though the event releases as an advent calender, it may be completed at any time after.

The choice of doing advent of Code is a demonstration of capability as well as comradery with others who choose to challenge themselves.

### Why Zig
Zig is a fun language that has challanged my thinking of problem solving. I wish to use it more heavily in the future, and advent of code seems like the perfect opportunity to learn it more thoroughly.

### How to Run
With zig installed on the system, simply run `zig build run` from the emplaced directory. A binary is produced in `./zig-out/bin/` which may be run with a supplied number to benchmark the days'.
